                    </div>
                    <p> <strong>Keto Diet. Effective? Is it dangerous, or does it cure all diseases?</strong><p><span>Today I will analyze the popular keto diet. There are countless articles and videos on this topic. In a large number of them, the keto diet is attributed almost magical properties for the treatment of almost all diseases, improving health, losing weight, and so on. How are you we have already guessed that this is an exaggeration, so let's get this straight.</span></p><p><span>What is the keto diet? In fact, this is a very low-carb diet, with a high percentage of fat and protein in the diet. On average, the caloric content of carbohydrates in this diet does not exceed 5%, 20% - from protein, and 75% - from fat.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Adore fatty:)</span></figcaption></figure><div><div></div></div><h3><span>Where does the keto diet come from?</span></h3><p><span>In the early 1900s, the keto diet became very widely used in the treatment of epilepsy. In 1921, Dr. Russell Wilder coined the name "keto diet", based on the concept of " </span><span></span><a>ketones </a><span>", substances that act as energy for the body in the body's energy system. when carbohydrates are not enough. Source: </span><span></span><a>the threshold of the ketogenesis </a><span>. The keto diet is still actively used to treat epileptic seizures.</span></p><p><span>Only in the 1970s, with the publication </span><span></span><a>of Atkins </a><span>' book , did low-carb diets become massively popular.</span></p><h3><span>Why do people think, what is the keto diet effective for burning fat?</span></h3><blockquote><span><u>The first reason </u></span><span>is the idea that insulin is produced mainly on carbohydrate-rich foods, and insulin is a "fat deposition" hormone, so by cutting down on carbohydrates, we reduce insulin and lose weight. It sounds logical, but there are problems. Research on this issue has shown that the model is too simplistic to claim that carbohydrates and insulin are the main culprits. Istochnik: "</span><span></span><a> </a><span></span><a><b>A review of the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity"</b></a></blockquote><blockquote><span>The fact is that it is not just carbohydrates that cause the release of insulin. For example, proteins also give an insulin release. Moreover, insulin is not required for fat deposits, there is also the so-called ASP enzyme (</span><span></span><a>acylation stimulating protein </a><span>). </span></blockquote><blockquote><span>It has long been obvious and well-known that the main factor in obesity is excess calories, and not a single hormone like insulin.</span></blockquote><p><span></span></p><blockquote><span><u>The second reason </u></span><span>is that according to the claims supporters of the keto diet, it gives a certain metabolic advantage over conventional diets. However, a 2013 study ( </span><span></span><a><b>Beyond weight loss: a review of the therapeutic uses of very-low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) diets</b></a><span>) </span><span><b></b></span><span>it showed that there was no "acceleration of metabolism" as a result of the keto diet. And in General scientific the community opposed this idea, as no evidence was found that the keto diet was more effective in metabolic terms than conventional diets. A source:  "</span><span></span><a><b>Ketogenic low-carbohydrate diets have no metabolic advantage over nonketogenic low-carbohydrate diets</b></a><span><b>"</b></span></blockquote><h2><span><b>What really happened?</b></span></h2><ul><li><span>Keto diet reduce appetite .</span></li><li><span>The keto diet reduces the amount of food allowed for consumption, including the most delicious and mouthwatering - carbohydrate-based foods.</span></li></ul><p><span>Through this, the keto diet allows you to be in a calorie deficit. And both of these points can be reached in other ways. </span></p><blockquote><span>Large meta-analysis " </span><span></span><a><b>Comparison of weight loss among named diet programs in overweight and obese adults: a meta-analysis.</b></a><span>"I compared dozens of different diets, including the keto diet, and it was concluded that all of them were effective for burning fat, the primary fact was the fact of reduced caloric intake, and finding the subjects in a deficit of calories. It was emphasized that for each individual person it was preferable to have your own diet, one that you can easily stick to for a long time.</span></blockquote><p><span>Another study "</span><span></span><a><b>Very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet V. low-fat diet for long-term weight loss: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials</b></a><span>" showed a slight advantage of the keto diet in fat burning, over other diets where carbohydrates are not cut to zero. However, researchers have linked this to increased protein intake among subjects on the keto diet. And protein is more satiating, and requires more energy to digest. A source:  "</span><span></span><a><b>Relatively high-protein or 'low-carb' energy-restricted diets for body weight loss and body weight maintenance?</b></a><span>"From what we can conclude that protein is extremely important it is important for weight loss.</span></p><h2><span>Insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular health</span></h2><p><span>The study 2018 " </span><span></span><a>4. Lifestyle Management: Standards of Medical Care in Diabetesd2018 </a><span>" showed that the keto diet can improve the condition of people with insulin resistance within 3-4 months, but longer periods do not they have been studied and can even be harmful.</span></p><p><span>Also, from there:</span></p><blockquote><span> "For people with diabetes, there is no ideal strategy in the distribution of protein, fat and carbohydrates, it must be selected individually, taking into account the overall caloric content and goals."</span></blockquote><p><span>Another meta-analysis " </span><span></span><a><b>Effects of low-carbohydrate diets V. low-fat diets on body weight and cardiovascular risk factors: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials </b></a><span>" showed a sharp increase in total cholesterol on the keto diet, but heart pressure in the groups with a regular diet and keto, did not differ.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Taken from </span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Summary</span></h2><ul><li><span>Do you have any keto diets incredible advantages, compared to the usual, balanced one. It seems that there is. </span></li><li><span>Is the keto diet dangerous for your health? It seems that there is. Carbohydrates are not a vital nutrient in the short term.</span></li></ul><p><span>If you like fat, but not very sweet, then it is quite likely that the keto diet will be for you a good option. Always remember that the best diet is the one that you can stick to for a long time. For example, I liked her. However, if you have high cholesterol, be careful and consult your doctor.</span></p><p><span>Do not expect any magic from it, as research shows, it is nothing in principle, it does not differ from the usual balanced calorie diets.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><b>Thank you for reading this, it took a lot of effort and time to prepare this article, I understand that the article is very difficult, but I will be very grateful to the thumbs up😊</b></span><span></span></p><blockquote><span><i>For consultations, drawing up a training manual plan and nutrition, please contact</i></span><span> </span><span></span><a><i></i></a></blockquote><blockquote><span><i>Read it the same way:</i></span></blockquote><blockquote><span> </span><span></span><a><b>Top abs exercises (according to science)</b></a></blockquote><blockquote><span></span><a> </a><span></span><a><b>Burn fat in your sleep?
